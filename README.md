# santocad
SantoCAD offers a simple GUI to create a complex scene in OpenGL. You can add all GLUT's objects (sphere, cube, teapot, torus, ..), move, rotate and scale it and also define lighting and texture.

Once created the scene, SantoCAD can generate it's source code. It's great for educational purposes but also for development aid.
